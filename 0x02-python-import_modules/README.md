# Python Import Modules Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts showcasing various concepts related to importing modules and functions. Below is a brief overview of each task:

## 1. Import a Simple Function

This script demonstrates importing a function from a separate file (`add_0.py`) and using it to perform a simple addition operation.

## 2. My First Toolbox

The script `1-calculation.py` showcases importing multiple functions from a module (`calculator_1.py`) and utilizing them to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## 3. How to Make a Script Dynamic

In `2-args.py`, the script dynamically handles input arguments and prints the number of arguments along with their values.

## 4. Infinite Addition

The script `3-infinite_add.py` performs the addition of an indefinite number of arguments passed to it.

## 5. Who Are You?

`4-hidden_discovery.py` reveals the names defined within a compiled Python module (`hidden_4.pyc`).

## 6. Everything Can Be Imported

This script `5-variable_load.py` imports a variable from another Python file and prints its value.

## 7. Build My Own Calculator!

The script `100-my_calculator.py` serves as a basic calculator, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations via command-line arguments.

## 8. Easy Print

`101-easy_print.py` demonstrates printing a specific string without using the `print` function.

## 9. ByteCode -> Python #3

In `102-magic_calculation.py`, a Python function is created to mimic the behavior specified by a given Python bytecode.

## 10. Fast Alphabet

The script `103-fast_alphabet.py` prints the alphabet in uppercase, showcasing a concise way to achieve this task.

Each script is accompanied by usage instructions and demonstrates different aspects of Python programming related to module imports, argument handling, and script execution.

Feel free to explore each script for a deeper understanding of Python's import functionality and script execution.
